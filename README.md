## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an annual programming challenge created by [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl). It's an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles released daily from December 1st through the 25th. The puzzles can be solved in any programming language and are designed for programmers of all skill levels.
